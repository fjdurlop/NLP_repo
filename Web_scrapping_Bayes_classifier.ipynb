       "['Fearless [Liner Notes] Lyrics\\n\\n\\n\\nTaylor\\'s Letter\\nThis album is called \"Fearless\", and I guess I\\'d like to clarify why we chose that as the title. To me, \"Fearless\" is not the absence of fear. It\\'s not being completely unafraid. To me, fearless is having fears. Fearless is having doubts. Lots of them. To me, fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death. Fearless is falling madly in love again, even though you\\'ve been hurt before. Fearless is walking into your freshman year of high school at fifteen. Fearless is getting back up and fighting for what you want over and over again...even though every time you\\'e tried before, you\\'ve lost. It\\'s fearless to have faith that someday things will change. Fearless is having the courage to say goodbye to someone who only hurts you, even if you can\\'t breathe without them. I think it\\'s fearless to fall for your best friend, even though he\\'s in love with someone else. And when someone apologizes to you enough times for things they\\'ll never stop doing, I think it\\'s fearless to stop believing them. It\\'s fearless to say \"you\\'re NOT sorry\", and walk away. I think loving someone despite what people think is fearless. I think allowing yourself to cry on the bathroom floor is fearless. Letting go is fearless. Then, moving on and being alright...That\\'s fearless too. But no matter what love throws at you, you have to believe in it. You have to believe in love stories and prince charmings and happily every after. That\\'s why I write these songs. Because I think love is fearless\\n\\n\\n1.
